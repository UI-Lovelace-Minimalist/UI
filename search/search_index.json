Else it could result in multiple errors in the dev-console of your browser.</p> <p>Follow this part to add a card to an option of your <code>input_select</code>: To add a light popup to your first light card you just have to add the corresponding entity:</p> <pre><code>type: custom:state-switch\nview_layout:\n  grid-area: popup\n  show:\n    mediaquery: \"(min-width: 1100px)\"\nentity: input_select.minimalist_ui # put your input_select here\ndefault: default\ntransition: slide-down\ntransition_time: 500\nstates:\n  ## Lights\n  light 1:\n    type: \"custom:button-card\"\n    template: \"popup_light_brightness\"\n    entity: \"&lt;your_entity&gt;\"\n</code></pre> <p>You can also add any other card by copying its yaml code in without the hyphen <code>(-)</code></p> <pre><code>states:\n  ## Lights\n  light 1:\n    type: \"custom:button-card\"\n    template: \"popup_light_brightness\"\n    entity: \"&lt;your_entity&gt;\"\n  card 1:\n    type: \"custom:button-card\"\n    template: \"&lt;your_template&gt;\"\n</code></pre> <p>Important!</p> <p>All options(devices) do need its own config in <code>popup.yaml</code>!</p> <p>To switch between popups we need to go back to <code>adaptive-dash/views/main.yaml</code>. Here we have to add two variables to the cards we want to show a popup off.

I have tested this with a cooling function that I use to control my beer fridge.</p> <p>The buttons are used to lower/raise the set temperature which is displayed between the arrows. It uses the defined steps configured on the thermostat (In my case I use esphome to control the frigde). The current temperature is shown in the grey label. The card uses the standard language parameters.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"usage/custom_cards/custom_card_mpse_thermostat/#credits","title":"Credits","text":"<p>Author: mpse Version: 0.1.0</p>"},{"location":"usage/custom_cards/custom_card_mpse_thermostat/#changelog","title":"Changelog","text":"0.1.0 Initial release inspired from various posts on home assistant forum."},{"location":"usage/custom_cards/custom_card_mpse_thermostat/#usage","title":"Usage","text":"<pre><code>- type: \"custom:button-card\"\n  template: custom_card_mpse_thermostat\n  entity: climate.fermentation_climate_controller\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"usage/custom_cards/custom_card_mpse_thermostat/#requirements","title":"Requirements","text":""},{"location":"usage/custom_cards/custom_card_mpse_thermostat/#variables","title":"Variables","text":"Variable Example Required Explanation None"},{"location":"usage/custom_cards/custom_card_mpse_thermostat/#template-code","title":"Template code","text":"Template Code custom_card_mpse_thermostat.yaml<pre><code>---\ncustom_card_mpse_thermostat:\n  show_name: false\n  show_icon: false\n  template:\n    -

To allow almost all entities from HomeAssistant to show in the news, you're able to set all options that <code>home-feed-card</code> provides. This makes it necessary, that you set these entities in a list. Let me show you an example:</p> <pre><code># normally you do this\nvariables:\n  ulm_variable: your_variable_entity\n\n# here you need to do a list\nvariables:\n  ulm_variable:\n    - your_variable_entity_1\n    - your_variable_entity_2\n\n# to use an option from home-feed-card\nvariables:\n  ulm_variable:\n    - entity: your_variable_entity_1\n      content_template: \"&lt;b&gt;{{ display_name }}&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;{{ state }}\"\n    - your_variable_entity_2\n</code></pre> <p>You can find all available options and their description here.</p> <p>I recommend to use a <code>content_template</code> to format the output for every news item, eg. like this:</p> <pre><code>content_template: \"&lt;b&gt;{{ display_name }}&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;{{ state }}\"\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"usage/custom_cards/custom_card_paddy_welcome/#example","title":"Example","text":"<pre><code>- type: custom:button-card\n  template: custom_card_paddy_welcome_with_news\n  variables:\n    ulm_custom_card_paddy_welcome_news_entities:\n      - entity: input_datetime.alarm_clock\n        content_template: \"&lt;b&gt;{{display_name}}&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;{{state}}\"\n      - entity: sensor.waste_collection_bio\n        content_template: \"&lt;b&gt;{{display_name}}&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;{{state}}\"\n      - entity: sensor.waste_collection_paper\n        content_template: \"&lt;b&gt;{{display_name}}&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;{{state}}\"\n      - entity: sensor.waste_collection_plastic\n        content_template: \"&lt;b&gt;{{display_name}}&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;{{state}}\"\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"usage/custom_cards/custom_card_paddy_welcome/#template-code","title":"Template code","text":"Template Code custom_card_paddy_welcome.yaml<pre><code>---\ncustom_card_paddy_welcome:\n  template:\n    - \"ulm_language_variables\"\n  show_icon: false\n  show_name: false\n  show_label: false\n  styles:\n    grid:\n      - grid-template-areas: \"'item1'\"\n      - grid-template-columns: \"1fr\"\n      - grid-template-rows: \"min-content\"\n      - row-gap: \"12px\"\n    card:\n      - border-radius: \"var(--border-radius)\"\n      - box-shadow: \"var(--box-shadow)\"\n      - padding: \"12px\"\n  custom_fields:\n    item1:\n      card:\n        type: \"markdown\"\n        content: &gt;\n          [[[\n            let time = states[variables.ulm_custom_card_paddy_welcome_time].state;\n            let welcome = '';\n\n            if (time &gt;
