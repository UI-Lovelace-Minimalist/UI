# UI-Lovelace-Minimalist
It's kind of hard to explain what this is, so let's call it a "theme" (in quotation marks). But one thing is for sure, it is very nice! Taking the exceptional work of tben as a basis, this repository is aimed to ease installation and maintainance of his wonderful work. You can use this interpretation of a SmartHomeUI more or less like a theme in HomeAssistant.

> ### Contributions
> This is a living project and all input is very welcome! If you configured and designed a card, that you would like to share, please feel free to do so! We are happy to include your contribution so others can use it as well!

## Wiki for documentation
We have setup an extensive Wiki for our documentation. It is more comfortable for you to read and for us to handle, than this file and gives our documentation the right framework to grow.

## Credits
* This design was made by [tben](https://community.home-assistant.io/u/tben/summary)
* A lot of inspiration is taken from [7ahangâ€™s work](https://www.behance.net/gallery/88433905/Redesign-Smart-Home) found on Behance.
* Contributions from others in the HomeAssistant forum thread, you can find it [here](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/lovelace-ui-minimalist/322687).
* The technical part is realised mostly by taking advantage of the great work RomRaider did with his [button-card](https://github.com/custom-cards/button-card).
* Code refactor, cleanup and maintainance schumijo and paddy0174.
* Wiki by paddy0174.
* Special thanks to clemalex and schumijo for contributing their cards to the main repository.

## This "theme" introduced
This "theme" provides you with four different elements, that combined give you a nice and functional layout. The basis for all these elements is `button-card` that allows for a great and individual styling. These elements, "cards", "chips", "title" and "vertical buttons", are fully customizable and can be enhanced to fit your needs.
All this is only possible, because we are able to use the templating function from `button-card`.

### Chips
At the top of each page you can find the `chips`, which allow to quickly visualize important information.

![Chips](./screenshots/chips.png)

### Title
`Titles` are used to separate the different sections. Kind of a divider.

![Title](./screenshots/title.png)

### Vertical buttons
`Vertical buttons` show the information vertically aligned. These find their use eg. as navigation or scene buttons.

![Title](./screenshots/scene.gif)

### Cards
`Cards` are the main part of this design and are widely used in very different designs and functions. With these `cards` you can set up nearly every entity in HA, showing from "state-only" over a "full blown" information graphic with various values to "controlling" your covers and climate entities.

![Cards](./screenshots/cards.png)

#### Anatomy of cards
![Anatomy](./screenshots/anatomy.png)
1. **Dot**: Visible when the device is unavailable. Also used on the entity **person**
2. **Icon**: Icon that represents the device
3. **Primary line**: Main information
4. **Secondary line**: Secondary information
5. **Optional part**: Possibility to display buttons to launch actions related to the device. Or display a graph to view the history of a sensor or you let your fantasy take the ride...

In the list above #5 enhances the normal `cards` with a "second line", that is used to display other information like a graph or the controls for your covers. For this readme the `cards` are divided into three groups:
* 1-line cards: These are cards for `sensor` or `binary_sensors` like *light* or *power outlets*.
* 2-line cards: These are cards with a second line for informations or controls, eg. your `cover controls`.
* Custom cards: These are special cards, that you can install, only if needed. These cards are mostly developed and contributed to the repository. Eg. an `aircondition-card` that shows the state of your aircondition and buttons to control it.

### Language specific buttons
Sometimes the language specific strings from Home Assistant aren't available for your button, so we added the possibility to use language specific strings over the template system.

### Custom cards
This "theme" is designed with an open structure in mind, that's why it is possible to add `custom-cards` without much hassle. A few `custom-cards` are readily available through the folder `custom-cards` in the repository.
`Custom-cards` are `cards`, that don't fit everywhere and therefor are not part of the standard installation, but can be easily added, if needed. Take an air-condition card. Not everybody has an air-condition. So why include this `card` as a default? And that's why we did a structure and system for `custom-cards`. Easily added, but only when needed!
And the best thing is: everybody can develop a cool `card` and can (not have to) share it afterwards with the community (hint, hint, the support thread is [here](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/lovelace-ui-minimalist/322687)).

See a complete list of already included `custom-cards` in our [wiki](https://ui-lovelace-minimalist.netlify.app/usage/template_list).

Find informations on how to develop a `custom-card` [here](https://ui-lovelace-minimalist.netlify.app/development/custom_card).

### Extend with your own code
As we tried to be as modular as possible (and useful), it is easy to enhance or extend the code, we provide with your own definitions. That means for you, you can inherit every template to enhance it only with functions, you really want. No need to copy full blocks of code - just inherit and enhance only where changes are needed.

We provided some instructions in our wiki, see [this page](https://ui-lovelace-minimalist.netlify.app/usage/changing_template).

### Code Generator(s)
We offer two (soon three) code generators, that support you in installing, getting example code and soon in configuring a button. Take a look at [this page](https://ui-lovelace-minimalist.netlify.app/codegen).

## Installation and update
At the moment there are two methods of installing this "theme", one for `yaml`-mode and one for `UI`-mode. We are working on getting this "theme" installable via HACS, but for now, we can only provide these two methods, sorry.

We can offer you in-depth instructions for installation, as well as for future updates or from a previous version. Check our WIKI for more info:
* [Instructions for installation in `yaml`-mode](https://ui-lovelace-minimalist.netlify.app/installation/yaml-mode)
* [Instructions for installation in `UI`-mode](https://ui-lovelace-minimalist.netlify.app/installation/ui-mode)
* [Update in `yaml`mode](https://ui-lovelace-minimalist.netlify.app/installation/update#yaml-mode)
* [Update in `UI`-mode](https://ui-lovelace-minimalist.netlify.app/installation/update#ui-mode)
* [Update from previous version](https://ui-lovelace-minimalist.netlify.app/installation/update#previous-version)

TL;DR
Download and copy content of `config` folder to HA `config` folder. Set link to include `button_card_templates`, install `lovelace-cards`, use example code to get started.

## List of templates
The actual version of this "theme" has 20 different cards, seven chips and other templates bundled into the download. We're sorry, but the list wouldn't fit into this readme. [Please see this page, where you can find an extensive list of templates with code examples, screenshots and explaination](https://ui-lovelace-minimalist.netlify.app/usage/template_list).

## Custom cards
The same goes for our `custom_cards`. As the number grows, the list would be to big for this readme, so we provide you with an overview page with pictures, code examples and additional informations. [Find the list here](https://ui-lovelace-minimalist.netlify.app/usage/custom_card_list).


## Legacy templates
As this "theme" evolved, there were some major changes and re-writes in the code, compared to the previous versions. That's why we tried to keep some legacy templates in place, to still be able to use your old template format.

We provide a list of all legacy templates we support [here](https://ui-lovelace-minimalist.netlify.app/development/legacy_templates).

And if you had installed one of the previous versions, we made a short write-up, on how you can move to the new format and be able to use this theme in the future with all it's features and without worrying about updates. Take a look [here](https://ui-lovelace-minimalist.netlify.app/installation/update#previous-version).
