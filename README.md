It's kind of hard to explain what this is, so let's call it a "theme" (in quotation marks). But one thing is for sure, it is very nice! Taking the exceptional work of tben as a basis, this repository is aimed to ease installation and maintenance of his wonderful work. You can use this interpretation of a SmartHomeUI more or less like a theme in HomeAssistant.

## Wiki for documentation

We have setup an extensive Wiki for our documentation. It is more comfortable for you to read and for us to handle, than this file and gives our documentation the right framework to grow.
Take a look here: [https://ui-lovelace-minimalist.github.io/UI/](https://ui-lovelace-minimalist.github.io/UI/)

## Installation and update

We can offer you in-depth instructions for installation, as well as for future updates or from a previous version. Check our WIKI for more info:

- [Download](https://ui-lovelace-minimalist.github.io/UI/setup/download/)
- [Installation](https://ui-lovelace-minimalist.github.io/UI/setup/installation/)
- [Configuration](https://ui-lovelace-minimalist.github.io/UI/setup/configuration/)

## List of templates

The actual version of this "theme" has 20 different cards, seven chips and other templates bundled into the download. We're sorry, but the list wouldn't fit into this readme. [Please see this page, where you can find an extensive list of templates with code examples, screenshots and explanation](https://ui-lovelace-minimalist.github.io/UI/usage/cards/card_battery/).

## Custom cards

The same goes for our `custom_cards`. As the number grows, the list would be to big for this readme, so we provide you with an overview page with pictures, code examples and additional information. [Find the list here](https://ui-lovelace-minimalist.github.io/UI/usage/custom_cards/custom_card_bar_card/).
