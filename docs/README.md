# Page repository for UI-Lovelace-Minimalist
This is the repository, where we maintain the source code for our wiki page.  

If you want to work locally on our wiki, you need to download these files and run them with Jekyll to generate the page.  

Our workflow is 
* this repository to maintain the files
* push changes to the main branch
* Netlify runs the build automatically and publishes the page
