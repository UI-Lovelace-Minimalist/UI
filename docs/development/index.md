# [](#development)Development

This “theme” was designed with an open structure in mind, so you can easily adapt and develop for it.

To get you started, take a look at our [custom-cards page](/development/custom_card), to show you the system this “theme” uses internally.

We also provide you with some extensive list of templates, that you can use to your likings and inherit from them.

We do know that developing can be a tideous task, but we appreciate every contribution to this “theme”. If you developed something great, why not share it with the community? We are always happy to help and to include your contribution into the main repository.

We are working on a concept, where you can make a PR to our Github repository and upload your `custom-card`. If we are ready with this, we’ll make an announcement.
