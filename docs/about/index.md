# [](#about)About

## [](#tools-and-software-used-in-this-project--on-the-wiki-page)Tools and software used in this project / on the wiki page

*   [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)  
    We use Jekyll to generate the static code for this wiki. See the ‚Äúpage‚Äù repository to take a look at the source code for the page, including the used Jekyll gems.
*   [Github](https://github.com)  
    We use Github to store our files and source code, for the main template files as well as for the source code of the wiki page. Versioning is, surprise, surprise, done by Git.
*   [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)  
    Netlify provides us with a really great service: they offer page hosting for free (for open-source projects) and have some neat tools to automatically deploy our website. Once configured, everything runs automatically. Thanks Netlify, your service is great!  
    Workflow:  
    Change code -> upload to Github -> commit the newest data to ‚Äúmain‚Äù-branch -> Netlify automatically detects changes -> run ‚Äúbuild‚Äù in Netlify automatically -> page gets deployed by Netlify automatically
*   On the wiki page:
    *   _[Jquery](https://jquery.com/)_ for easier code in javascript
    *   _[JS-Yaml](https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml)_ to generate the formatted yaml code in CodeGenerators
