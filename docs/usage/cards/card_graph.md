## Description

![example-image](../../assets/img/ulm_cards/card_graph.png){ width="500" }

The `card_graph` shows an entity with the actual state and a *min-graph-card* integrated. This can be used for a thermostat to show the actual temperature and the history. It now supports dual graphs as well as bar style graphs.

## Variables

| Variable | Default | Required         | Notes             |
|----------|---------|------------------|-------------------|
| entity      |         | :material-check: | Your entity_id for the temperature sensor |
| ulm_card_graph_color     |         | :material-close: | This is to adjust your color value. Use a CSS variable from HA or set a color value (eg. #FFFFFF) |
| ulm_card_graph_name      |         | :material-close: | Set graph name |
| ulm_card_graph_icon    |         | :material-close: | Set custom icon |
| ulm_card_graph_entity      |         | :material-check: | Your entity_id for the temperature sensor |
| ulm_card_graph_entity2      |         | :material-close: | Your entity_id for the second temperature sensor |
| ulm_card_graph_color2      |         | :material-close: | This is to adjust your color value of the second graph. Use a CSS variable from HA or set a color value (eg. #FFFFFF) |
| ulm_card_graph_type      | fill | :material-close: | This is to change the appearance of the graph. Default is fill, but line, bar are valid options. |
| ulm_card_graph_hours      |  24 | :material-close: | How much time should the graph cover, default is 24 hours. |
| ulm_card_graph_points      | 0.5 | :material-close: | Specify amount of data points the graph should display for each hour. A larger number results in a more detailed graph. |
| ulm_card_graph_group_by | interval | :material-close: | Specify type of grouping of data, dynamic interval, date or hour. |
| ulm_card_graph_line_width | 5 | :material-close: | Set the thickness of the line. |

## Usage

```yaml
  - type: 'custom:button-card'
    template: card_graph
    entity: sensor.livingroom_temperature
    variables:
      ulm_card_graph_color: "var(--google-blue)"
      ulm_card_graph_name: Temperature Livingroom
      ulm_card_graph_entity: sensor.livingroom_temperature
      ulm_card_graph_color2: "var(--google-green)"
      ulm_card_graph_entity2: sensor.bedgroom_temperature
      ulm_card_graph_type: fill
      ulm_card_graph_hours: 24
      ulm_card_graph_group_by: interval
      ulm_card_graph_line_width: 5
