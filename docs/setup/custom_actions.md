!!! tip "Reloading"

    Once you have edited `custom_actions.yaml` file, you must reload `"UI LOVELACE MINIMALIST"` configuration.
    Just go to `"Configuration" --> "Settings"` in Home Assistant and press the `"UI_LOVELACE_MINIMALIST"` button within the "YAML configuration reloading" section.

## Navigate action

To define the path of `navigate` action, add one of the following depending on your action :

- ulm_card_tap_navigate_path
- ulm_card_hold_navigate_path
- ulm_card_double_tap_navigate_path
- ulm_icon_tap_navigate_path
- ulm_icon_hold_navigate_path
- ulm_icon_double_tap_navigate_path
- ulm_name_tap_navigate_path
- ulm_name_hold_navigate_path
- ulm_name_double_tap_navigate_path

```yaml
- type: "custom:button-card"
  template: "card_cover"
  entity: "cover.somfy_portail"
  variables:
    ulm_name_hold_action: "navigate"
    ulm_name_hold_navigate_path: "/adaptive-dash/Livingroom"

```

## Overwrite custom actions

When creating a dashboard, custom actions can be overwritten on your card definition.
For example, this code will overwrite the tap action on card with `more-info` action :

```yaml
- type: "custom:button-card"
  template: "card_cover"
  entity: "cover.somfy_portail"
  variables:
    ulm_card_tap_action: "more-info"

```

## For developpers

To enable action customization on your custom cards, use the following templates `icon_more_info_new` and `ulm_actions_card`
