## Install Integration

Open your Home Assistant instance and start setting up "UI Lovelace Minimalist" under "Configuration" --> "Devices & Services". Or you can use the My Home Assistant Button bellow.

!!! danger "Unsaved Settings"

    Currently the settings are not stored between initial setup and the settings after installation. After installation the settings drop back to their default values. This bug is reported and looked at.

Now you can configure the Integration, you can do this also after it's installed!

![hacs_integration_config](../assets/img/setup/hacs_integration_config.png)

- Language: Will set the language for the Integration.
- Side panel enabled: If you want to add an Entry in the Side Panel for the auto generated Dashboard. (Still under heavy development!)
- Side panel title: Will set the title for the Lovelace Dashboard in the Sidebar.
- Side panel icon: Which icon to put in front of the Title.
- Theme: Choose a theme of your choice (Note: Both themes will be installed anyway and can be customized later if needed.)

!!! note ""

    Currently, it may happen that themes are not automatically selected correctly for you in all cases automatically. Please make sure that the minimalist theme is correctly selected in your Home Assistant settings (click on your profile picture in Home Assistant, bottom left).

- Theme path: Make sure this is set to the same path as is configured in your `configuration.yaml` (default: `themes/`)

!!! note ""

    Please make sure that you have included this themes/ folder in your `configuration.yaml` in the [frontend settings](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/frontend/). Unfortunately, this is something that the HACS integration cannot do for you. If you use the themes/ folder, your entry in `configuration.yaml` must look like this for example:

    ```yaml
    frontend:
      themes: !include_dir_merge_named themes
    ```

- Include Custom Cards: This will make sure almost all dependency cards are included and configured for you.

!!! danger ""

    Activate **"Include Custom Cards"** only if you have not already installed the required Lovelace resources yourself, or if you dont want to install them by yourself. Otherwise this can currently lead to a freeze of the frontend due to double loaded lovelace resources.

Hit submit and in the Sidebar a new Dashboard entry should appear.
A new file for the dashboard configuration, with a small example, where you can generate your own layout should have been created under that location:

```yaml
config
└── ui_lovelace_minimalist
    ├── custom_cards
    └── dashboard
        └── ui-lovelace.yaml
```

In case you want to use your own ui-lovelace files go to [Configuration](../configuration).
