    2. Clear your cache by clicking `CTRL + F5` on Windows or `SHIFT + reload` on Mac

??? info "The theme looks off/weird"

    Check if you have applied the Minimalist theme. Go to User_profile --> theme

??? info "Weird border lines after updating to HA `2022.11.0`"

    1. Check in Minimalist version `v1.1.6` or higher is installed
    2. Check in `config/themes/` if this line is added to the minimalist theme files:
    ```yaml
        # fix added border-lines in 2022.11
        ha-card-border-width: "0px"
    ```
    3. Go to the affected dashboard on a PC and hit `C` on your keyboard. Then select `reload Themes`.

??? info "Custom element doesn't exist"

    1. Check if you did install all [dependencies](https://ui-lovelace-minimalist.github.io/UI/setup/download/#prerequisites_1) or checked the box to let UI-Minimalist them.
    2. (additional) If the dependencies are installed manually check if all resources are added right. [![Open your Home Assistant instance and show your dashboard resources.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/lovelace_resources.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/lovelace_resources/)
    3. Clear your cache by clicking `CTRL + F5` on Windows or `SHIFT + reload` on Mac.

??? info "Popups do not show up"

    1.  Check if you have installed [Browser_mod V2](https://github.com/thomasloven/hass-browser_mod#installation-instructions) correctly.
    2.  Check if you followed the card specific way to enable popups <br>
        *This is either with adding a template or setting a variable to `true`*

??? info "Custom card template does not exist/showing up"

    1. Check if you placed the custom_card in the right directory
    ```yaml
    config
        └── ui_lovelace_minimalist
            ├── custom_cards
            |   ├── custom_card_1
            |   |   ├── custom_card_1.yaml
            |   |   └── EN.yaml
            |   └── custom_card_2
            |       ├── custom_card_2.yaml
            |       └── EN.yaml
            └── dashboard
    ```
    2. Hit `C` and click reload `Ui_lovelace_minimalist`
    3. Reload dashboard by clicking the three dots in the upper-right corner and click refresh

??? info "HACS Frontend resources are not showing up in `https://homeassistant.local/config/lovelace/resources`"

    1. First check what is being displayed when you download a frontend component. If it's showing something like:

        > since you are not using Lovelace in storage mode you need to manually add the resource with these settings

    2. First make sure your configuration file has the setting:
    ```yaml
    lovelace:
      mode: storage
    ```
    3. In case it still shows that error. go to `https://homeassistant.local/config/system_health` and search for what is under: Dashboard -> Mode. if that is on `auto-gen`.
        Go to the autogenerated lovelace dashboard. and hit the 3 dots and `Edit Dashboard`. And just hit Save dashboard.
    4. Now go and restart Home assistant. and try to install a frontend module. It should not show the message from step 1.
