## Usage

```yaml
- type: "custom:button-card"
  template:
    - card_esh_room
    - yellow_on
  name: Bathroom
  entity: light.bathroom_lights
  icon: mdi:bathtub
  tap_action:
    action: navigate
    navigation_path: "bathroom"
  variables:
    ulm_custom_card_esh_room_light_entity: light.bathroom_lights
    ulm_custom_card_esh_room_climate_entity: climate.bathroom
  label: '[[[ return states["sensor.room_temperature"].state + "¬∞C" ]]]'
```

## Customizations

To add both temperature and humidity (as shown below) to the card, replace the label section with this code:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51805396/170957237-4025b2c0-2532-49e6-a908-d45c1f7a0728.png)

```yaml
label: >
  [[[
    return "üå°Ô∏è " + states['sensor.temperature'].state + " ¬∞C" + " üíß " + states['sensor.humidity'].state + " %"
  ]]]
```

You can also replace üå°Ô∏è and üíß with any desired Emoji, and sensor.room_temperature/sensor.room_humidity to match any of your HA entities you would like to be displayed. Ensure that the correct units of measurement are also updated (or removed) to match your custom entities. In this example they are ¬∞C and %.
